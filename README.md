<h2 id="about">Occtoo</h2>

Occtoo is an Experience Data Platform designed to accelerate the way companies create meaningful customer experiences across various touchpoints. Our platform is tailored to assist digital officers, marketers, and developers in transitioning to a new paradigm where they can dedicate less time to data integration and more time to unleashing their creative potential with data.

An Occtoo Destination offers one or more endpoints that allow you to query specific subsets of your data. It also encompasses facets and various mechanisms for fine-tuning queries by leveraging them.

For more in-depth information about how to query a destination, please refer to the [destination docs](https://docs.occtoo.com/docs/get-started/call-custom-destination/).
